We aim to maintain a commons style of coding. Some of the coding idioms recur often. In cases where these patterns are not captured already by a good, third party, open source library we put them in dans-scala-lib . The objects, classes and functions in this library are intended to be useful for all of our projects. The library only declares a minimal number of dependencies.
